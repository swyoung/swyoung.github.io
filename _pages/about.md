# About

![profile image](../assets/img/profile_circle_small.png)

I’m a [User Experience & Assessment Librarian and associate professor](https://www.lib.montana.edu/directory/1524782/scott-w.-h.-young) at [Montana State University](https://www.montana.edu). As a researcher-practitioner, I develop theory and practice in the field of library user experience (UX). 

I [publish](/cv#publications) and [present](/cv#presentations) widely on library UX, assessment, participatory design, privacy, and ethics.

I’ve been invited to present my work on participatory design to the University of Washington, the Orbis Cascade Alliance, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the Kentucky Library Association, and the California Libraries Learn (CALL) Academy. I’m a past co-convener of the [DLF Privacy and Ethics in Technology Working Group](https://wiki.diglib.org/Privacy_and_Ethics_in_Technology), and I hosted a [National Forum on Web Privacy and Web Analytics](https://www.lib.montana.edu/privacy-forum/) with [support from the Institute of Museum and Library Studies](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-73-18-0100-18). In 2019 I was named a [Library Journal Mover & Shaker](https://www.libraryjournal.com/story/scott-w-h-young-movers-shakers-2019-innovators). I currently serve as editor-in-chief of [Weave: Journal of Library User Experience](http://weaveux.org/), where I collaborate with a team of editors in shaping the professional and scholarly conversation around UX in libraries.

I hold an MA in [Archives and Public History from New York University](https://wp.nyu.edu/nyuhistoryma/aph-program-details/), an MS in [Library and Information Science from Long Island University](https://www.liu.edu/palmer), and a PhD in [Library and Information Science from Humboldt University of Berlin](https://www.ibi.hu-berlin.de/en/about-us), with a [dissertation that examines the ethical practice of library assessment](https://doi.org/10.18452/25372).
