# About

![profile image](../assets/img/profile_circle_small.png)

I’m a [User Experience Librarian and professor](https://www.lib.montana.edu/directory/1524782/scott-w.-h.-young) at [Montana State University](https://www.montana.edu).

In my practice, I apply a set of design methods—user‑centered design, service design, participatory design, and content strategy—to improve library services. As a researcher, I examine library UX and assessment from three perspectives: user participation, practitioner self-reflection, and professional ethics. I [publish](/cv#publications) and [present](/cv#presentations) widely on these topics.

I’ve been invited to present my work on participatory design to the University of Washington, the Orbis Cascade Alliance, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the Kentucky Library Association, and the California Libraries Learn (CALL) Academy. I’m a past co-convener of the [DLF Privacy and Ethics in Technology Working Group](https://wiki.diglib.org/Privacy_and_Ethics_in_Technology), and I hosted a [National Forum on Web Privacy and Web Analytics](https://www.lib.montana.edu/privacy-forum/) with [support from the Institute of Museum and Library Studies](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-73-18-0100-18). In 2019 I was named a [Library Journal Mover & Shaker](https://www.libraryjournal.com/story/scott-w-h-young-movers-shakers-2019-innovators).

I currently serve as editor-in-chief of [Weave: Journal of Library User Experience](http://weaveux.org/), where I create and sustain strategic partnerships, monitor budgets and support fundraising initiatives to ensure journal sustainability, and coordinate with the journal's editorial board and publisher to ensure alignment across strategic, production, and editorial goals. I also support the journal's team of editors in cultivating <em>Weave</em>'s author-centered and collaborative editorial approach.

I hold an MA in [Archives and Public History from New York University](https://wp.nyu.edu/nyuhistoryma/aph-program-details/), an MS in [Library and Information Science from Long Island University](https://www.liu.edu/palmer), and a PhD in [Library and Information Science from Humboldt University of Berlin](https://www.ibi.hu-berlin.de/en/about-us), with a [dissertation that examines the ethical practice of library assessment](https://doi.org/10.18452/25372).
